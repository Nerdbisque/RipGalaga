# Overview

This is a class based arcade shooter such as galaga. Written in c# to understand the interacies and dependencies that c# provides over languages such as python of which I have plenty of experience.

The purpose of this software is to recreate galaga using step by step frames within a art generation. such as raylib. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

In the development and understanding of teh C# language I dove into the ralib which is a system that allows one to program video game styles.

# Future Work

- I need a working ending to the game. right now it only gathers points via shooting the different colored blocks but no actual ending
